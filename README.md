This repository contains codes for a chemometrics project. 
multiple machine learning algorithms have been implemented in order to enahnce the outcome and also for double checking the results a previously ppublish paper : "Design of high bulk moduli high
entropy alloys using machine learning"
This project was done by Erfan Nasrollahi and Setayesh Khalili
